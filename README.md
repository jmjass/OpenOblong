# OpenRectangleCubsMod
Custom PCBs for a RP2040 powered rectangle controller.

Modified version of https://github.com/Armastardo/OpenRectangle that decreases size of the PCB and changes button layout to accomodate.

Original Dimensions: 339.13mm x 141.22mm

Modified Dimensions: 282.7mm x 136.22mm

Case Dimensions: 296mm x 154.4mm (~11.65" x ~6.08")

(Thickness of the case varies based on thickness of acrylic layers)

Calculate the thickness of your case and order standoffs about 1mm shorter than the case.

Any M2 screws will work, I got these because I wanted black ones that are flush with the case.

There is a huge variety of colors and different designs of acrylic offered by these guys but they are a bit more expensive than other places. Also I had to pay about $17 for shipping so be sure to account for shipping costs in budget. If you order a 12 x 19 inch sheet from here you are able to cut 3 layers out of it.

If you are trying to make it as cheap as possible, I would recommend shopping around for clear acrylic because clear seemed to be the cheapest when I was looking. Here are a couple different thickness ones from amazon that I found:

1/8" For Top/Bottom Layers + PCB Layers on Aluminum Switchplate Design: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XR8NB28?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

Acrylic Switchplate (.06"): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LTYDYKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

PCB Layer/Hotswap Cutout Layer on Acylic Switchplate Design (.08"): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N3PN8PG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1

I recommend doing some searching on your own as there may be different options that are cheaper. 8" x 12" works the best for cutting 1 panel per sheet and for getting mroe than 1 panel per sheet you need multiples of 6.315" x 12". For example, 12" x 19" can get you 3 layers with very little margin of error or 12" x 21" would get you 3 layers way more comfortable although you are unlikely to find this size and would more commonly find 12" x 24"
