# OpenRectangle
Custom PCBs for a RP2040 powered rectangle controller.

Modified version of https://github.com/Armastardo/OpenRectangle that decreases size of the PCB and changes button layout to accomodate.

Original Dimensions: 339.13mm x 141.22mm

Modified Dimensions: 282.7mm x 136.22mm

Please note that this design is untested for now.

Includes stacked acrylic case design with aluminum switchplate or fully acrylic design with acrylic switchplate. 

Case Dimensions: 298.8mm x 160.4mm x ~16.6mm (~11.76" x ~6.31" x ~0.654") Thickness calculated based off of 3mm top panel, 1.6mm switchplate, 3 pcb layers/2 pcb layers and a hotswap layer all 3mm, and a 3mm base layer.

(Thickness of the case varies based on thickness of acrylic layers)

Calculate the thickness of your case and order standoffs about 1mm shorter than the case.

Any M2 screws will work, I got these because I wanted black ones that are flush with the case.

I would recommend going with the ebay ones, I got the digikey ones because I didn't find the ebay ones before I ordered but they are much more expensive. If you go with the ebay ones you can make the mounting holes in the switchplate 1.8mm and screw them in from both sides. If you go with the digikey ones then you will have to mount the standoffs to the bottom of the switchplate (I am using JBWeld for this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006O1ICY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). You can probably do the same thing with the ebay ones as well if you don't want to do screws on both sides.

If you are gluing the standoffs to the board then you want M1.6 x 4mm screws but if you are doing 1 screw on each side then you should get M1.6 x 3mm.

Looking into a way to 3D print something like this. There needs to be something to keep the PCB from sliding around in the case so my current plan is to get pins to put through the screw holes on PCB and glue them to the layer the PCB rests on. Pins should be ~1.6mm in diameter (holes on pcb are 1.8mm) and minimum length of 3mm but I think that 4-4.5mm would be ideal.
